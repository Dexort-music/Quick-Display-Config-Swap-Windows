<h2>[DONE]</h2>

- [x] main functions
- [x] serialization and deserialization of configs
- [x] simple test ui
- [x] tested - concept works flawlessly on my machine, if all monitors are connected
- [x] code cleanup (tidy-up the structure a bit, remove unused or test functions)
- [x] working from tray
- [x] rmb context menu ui


<h2>[TODO]</h2>

- [ ] console ui (creating/deleting/applying configs)
- [ ] ~~replace default Win+P behaviour (if possible)~~ make custom Alt+Win+P keyboard shortcut for fast swapping
- [ ] testing to break the system (monitors connecting/disconnecting, changing monitor resolutions/scaling/rotation on the fly and so on)
- [ ] testing on as many machines (do it at your own risk)
